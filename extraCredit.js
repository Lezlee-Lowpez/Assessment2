// Identify 3 software or technology companies the interest you.
// Conduct research to figure out some or all of the elements of each company’s technology stack. Check job openings/job descriptions, engineering blogs, and anything else that may have information about what the company uses to write/build it’s software products.
// Record your findings in a google doc. If you can find information about why the company chose that stack, include that as well.
// Save your files and push them to GitHub with your code.

// Pinterest, Spotify, Apple

// Pinterest - originally built off python and sql its grown to include a lot more : Java, Python, JavaScript, C++ and Go. At the end they have a sharp focus on building models that organically show pinners related material to what they are searching for and work hard to make sure that their home page data is different from the models in their search page data, etc…

// Build out Pinner-facing frontend features in iOS to power the future of inspiration on Pinterest
// Contribute to and lead each step of the product development process, from ideation to implementation to release; from rapidly prototyping, running A/B tests, to architecting and building solutions that can scale to support millions of users
// Partner with design, product, and backend teams to build end to end functionality
// Put on your Pinner hat to suggest new product ideas and features
// Employ automated testing to build features with a high degree of technical quality, taking responsibility for the components and features you develop
// Grow as an engineer by working with world-class peers on varied and high impact project
// What We’re Looking For:
// Deep understanding of iOS development and best practices in Objective C and/or Swift, e.g. Xcode, app states, memory management, etc
// 3+ years of industry iOS application development experience, building consumer or business facing products
// Experience in following best practices in writing reliable and maintainable code that may be used by many other engineers
// Ability to keep up-to-date with new technologies to understand what should be incorporated
// Strong collaboration and communication skills


// Spotify’s tech stack includes : Java: Spotify's main programming language is Java. They use the Spring Framework for building RESTful APIs and for managing dependencies.
// Scala: Spotify also uses Scala for building some of its core services. Scala is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
// Node.js: Some of Spotify's back-end services are also built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that is designed to build scalable network applications.
// Apache Kafka: Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that allows for real-time data processing and messaging. Spotify uses Kafka for streaming music and handling events in real-time.
// Apache Cassandra: Cassandra is a NoSQL database that is designed for high availability and scalability. Spotify uses Cassandra for storing user data, such as playlists and music libraries.
// Redis: Redis is an in-memory key-value data store that is used for caching frequently accessed data. Spotify uses Redis for caching metadata about songs, albums, and artists.
// Docker: Spotify uses Docker for containerization, which makes it easy to deploy and manage its microservices. Docker allows Spotify to package its services into lightweight containers that can be run on any platform.
// Overall, it doesn’t seem like their main tech stack matches up with where I'm at. Currently there are no job postings for spotify so i wasn't able to see what they look for in particular. 


// Apple
// Their tech stack includes objective - c and swift, and seem to use a framework called cocoa. 
// There is currently no job postings on apple as well except for and It help : Qualifications:
// - Proven experience in a help desk or technical support role.
